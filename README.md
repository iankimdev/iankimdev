# Back-End Developer
I have a passion for **problem solving and optimization**, with a deep interest in mathematics and data. I want to become a developer with in-depth knowledge and a **trusted colleague**. We communicate and share ideas and experiences with other developers.

I want to have a **positive impact** on human life. I decided to become a developer because I wanted to work for people through my passion for computers. My career goal is to **contribute to human life** through the services I create.
